hi. I'm Thien. a 19-yr old engineering student.

\
my journey has been rather [ unorthodox ]. 

i spent the majority of high school dabbling in the music world. my days were filled with violin practice and transcibing pieces

then coding came along the way...  and so did a few trips across the country for some hackathons. 

suddenly I found myself in the tech world. now, i am currently studying computer science. AI/ML, HCI space

my interests are in developing and improving software for social good. in particular, I am researching how AI-based tools and platforms can have a positive
impact on the educational experience of engineering students.

my hobbies are
* playing the piano and improvising tunes
* late night study sessions on caffeine
* studying cognitive and psychological phenomena 
* consuming sci-fi and dystopian literature & games

thank you for taking your time to read my profile. i try not to yap too much
